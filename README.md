# Flutter Lab ðŸ”¥ðŸ§ª
A collection of Flutter projects built from tutorials, inspiration, and out of sheer curiosity.  
A lot of the work here is going to be broken or look incomplete, this is on purpose as I am trying to learn the fundamentals and features pretaining to a specific concept described in that project's README. That said I mostly try to be a perfectionist, but I am starting to get in the habit of delivering a MVP.

##### Some Projects that, I feel ,are worth mentioning:  
  
### World Time
This project was inspired by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg "The Net Ninja")'s Tutorial series' [final project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WghpP9W2vXo&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=22 "Final Project series video link")  
I added some of my own logic and assets wherever I could to make it my own to some extent, but full credit goes to [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg "The Net Ninja") for the tutorial series. I followed along, trying to learn as much as I could.
